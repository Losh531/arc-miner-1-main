# Arc-io "Miner"

### https://arc.io is A new way to make money. Arc is a peer-to-peer Content Delivery Network (CDN). Add Arc's widget to your website, your users share bandwidth, we rent it, and you get paid the proceeds. 


So I thought I'd use a package called [puppeteer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer).

It lets you control google chrome, and in this case the code goes to a page with arc, thus you can earn money.

Then the next problem was how do you host it? 

**I used my vps [(GalaxyGate)](https://galaxygate.net)**

### In the end you can earn up to 1.00$ every 3 days
